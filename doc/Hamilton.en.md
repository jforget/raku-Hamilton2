This  project  aims  at   extracting  doubly  hamiltonian  paths  from
administrative maps. In a connected graph, an
[Hamiltonian path](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HamiltonianPath.html)
is a  path crossing each vertex  exactly once. But what  is a _doubly_
Hamiltonian path?  Let us consider  the administrative map  of France.
France  is  split  into  _régions_,  which  are  in  turn  split  into
_départements_. For the purpose of  this project, we put aside Corsica
and overseas  regions, so the  resulting graph is connected.  A doubly
Hamiltonian path  is an hamiltonian path  crossing each one of  the 94
departments, with  the additional  constraint that when  narrowing the
view on any single region, the partial path is still Hamiltonian.

Checking whether  an Eulerian path  exists in  a connected graph  is a
well-known  problem. Checking  whether an  Hamiltonian path  exists is
more  difficult,   it  is  even   an  NP-complete  problem.   With  94
departments, a brute-force  approach would exceed the  resources I may
allow to  my hobbies. By  adding the _doubly_  Hamiltonian constraint,
the  size of  the  problem is  considerably  smaller. This  constraint
allows a  "divide and conquer"  approach. I  just have to  extract all
Hamiltonian macro-paths between the  12 regions in continental France,
then for each region I extract all Hamiltonian micro-paths linking the
departments  within  this  single  region (5  to  13  departments  per
region). Lastly,  I concatenate micro-paths while  following a pattern
given by a macro-path.

I do not study  only the map of France with  the departments from 1965
and the  regions from  2015. I  will do the  same experiment  with the
regions from  1970 and the  departments, ot  even with the  regions of
2015 as the big  areas and the regions of 1970 as  the small areas. In
this case,  there are several big  areas which contain only  one small
area, so this  set of data might  trigger a few bugs  which would stay
undiscovered with the other sets of data.

I can even think of other maps, such as the world map for
[Risk](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181/risk)
or
[War on Terror](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24396/war-terror),
in which the small areas are countries (more or less)
and the big areas are continents.

Database
========

Maps
----

The  first  table  is  the  `Maps` table.  It  just  contains  a  code
(URL-friendly, no special characters) and a description. It is used in
the website's main page, so the user can choose which map to display.

Areas
-----

The second table, `Areas`, contains both the regions and the departments.
The record key is:

* `map` the key of the wole map,
* `level` an integer with values `1` for regions and `2` for departments,
* `code` the last element of the key.

In France, departments  are associated with a  2-digit number (3-digit
for overseas departments, but they are out of the scope). This 2-digit
number will be used for `code`. For regions (the 2015 variant), I have
used the last 3 characters of ISO 3166-2, as seen
[on this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:FR#First-level_metropolitan_subdivisions).
For regions (the  1970 variant), I have used  unofficial 3-letter code
similar to the code for the 2015-variant regions.

Other fields are:

* `name` the standard designation of the region / department,
* `long` and `lat`, approximate longitude and latitude of the area,
* `color` the color used when drawing the map,
* `upper` for departments, it is the code of the region it belongs to, for regions this field is unused.

Two view are defined on  this table, `Big_Areas` which filters `level`
equal  to `1`  for regions  and  `Small_Areas` which  filters `2`  for
departments.

The longitude and latitude will be used to draw the maps. Although the
current problem of Hamiltonian paths is strictly a math graph problem,
with no geometry  involved, the math graphs will be  displayed in such
fashion that  the geographical  map associated can  be guessed  at and
recognised.

Borders
-------

The `Borders` table  lists the pairs of neighbour  departments and the
pairs of neighbour regions. For a math graph, the proper word would be
"edges". The key contains:

* `map` the key from table `Maps`,
* `level` with `1` for neighbouring regions and `2` for neighbouring departments,
* `from_code` for the first area,
* `to_code` for the second ares.

Other fields:

* `upper_from` the code of the region for departments' edges, empty for regions' edges,
* `upper_to` similar,
* `long`
* `lat`.

Most of the time,  the longitude and latitude will be  zero and in the
picture  of the  map, the  edge  will be  shown as  a single  straight
segment. In some  cases, the picture will be a  bit overcrowed in some
spots. A way  to unclutter the picture  is to draw a few  edges as two
straight segments,  bypassing the overcrowed  spot. In this  case, the
longitude and latitude define where the edge parts will join.

For a  given edge or border,  there will be two  `Borders` records, by
switching `from_code` with `to_code`.

As  for table  `Areas`, there  will  be two  views, `Big_Borders`  and
`Small_Borders`.
